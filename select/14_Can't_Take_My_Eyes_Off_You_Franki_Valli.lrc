[00:16.44] You're just too good to be true
[00:20.10] Can't take my eyes off of you
[00:23.97] You'd be like Heaven to touch
[00:27.96] I wanna hold you so much
[00:39.96] 
[00:31.77] At long last love has arrived
[00:35.87] And I thank God I'm alive

[01:10.01] You're just too good to be true
[01:14.16] Can't take my eyes off you
[01:27.16] 
[01:34.78] I love you, baby
[01:37.96] And if it's quite alright
[01:39.99] I need you, baby
[01:42.07] To warm a lonely night
[01:43.95] I love you, baby
[01:46.58] Trust in me when I say
[01:57.58]

[01:53.52] Don't bring me down, I pray
[01:55.62] Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
[01:59.38] And let me love you, baby
[02:02.87] Let me love you
[02:10.37]

[02:10.46] Can't take my eyes off of you
[02:14.15] You'd be like Heaven to touch

[02:22.61] At long last love has arrived
[02:26.46] And I thank God I'm alive

[02:33.97] Can't take my eyes off you
[02:46.97] 
[02:47.03] I love you, baby
