[00:16.06] You're just too good to be true
[00:19.87] Can't take my eyes off of you
[00:23.85] You'd be like Heaven to touch
[00:27.66] I wanna hold you so much
[00:39.66] 
[00:31.52] At long last love has arrived
[00:35.50] And I thank God I'm alive

[00:47.34] Pardon the way that I stare
[00:50.98] There's nothing else to compare

[00:58.42] There are no words left to speak

[01:10.18] You're just too good to be true
[01:13.97] Can't take my eyes off you
[01:26.97] 
[01:35.02] I love you, baby
[01:37.73] And if it's quite alright
[01:39.62] I need you, baby
[01:41.81] To warm a lonely night
[01:43.69] I love you, baby
[01:46.11] Trust in me when I say
[01:57.11]

[01:53.37] Don't bring me down, I pray
[01:55.35] Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
[01:59.02] And let me love you, baby
[02:02.72] Let me love you
[02:10.22]

[02:10.59] Can't take my eyes off of you
[02:14.30] You'd be like Heaven to touch

[02:22.36] At long last love has arrived
[02:26.06] And I thank God I'm alive
[02:29.89] You're just too good to be true
[02:33.72] Can't take my eyes off you
[02:46.72] 
[02:47.08] I love you, baby
